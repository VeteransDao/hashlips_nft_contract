# VET DAO Contracts

### 8020 NFT

Directs 80% of the NFT revenue to charities specified in the contract. The reamaining 20% is split between the Veterans DAO and the Creator of the NFT. On the roadmap is for subsequent transactions to also follow this split, with 10% going to the current owner, 10% to the DAO, and the remaining 80% again to charity.
